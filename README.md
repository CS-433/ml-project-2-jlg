CS-433 Road segmentation project

We trained a Unet to perform an image segmentation on a road dataset. Our best result and parameters can be found in ... and the test on this modle can be performed using the run.py parameter. 
To do so, download the whole repositor as it is and just run run.py.

If you wish to retune our model, you can change this line and run train.py. You can also tune a new model by changing the parameters in bold at the beginning of train.py before running it.
